I would really like to thank you for your detailed and professional work. It helped me a lot that you were always available, kept in touch continuously, and answered all my questions almost immediately. You showed me so many ideas and practical solutions I would have never thought of myself; you tailored them perfectly to my style and vision.
I'm especially grateful for your speed, flexibility, and the detailed product list.
I'm sure this will be very useful later on. I can't wait to see the plans come to life!`,
